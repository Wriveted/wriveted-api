# ü§ñ 

Welcome human to a brief outline of the Wriveted API. 

Use this API to add, edit, and remove information about Users, Books, Schools
and Libraries.

The API is designed for use by multiple users:
- **Library Management Systems**. In particular see the section on 
  updating and setting Schools collections.
- **Wriveted Staff** either directly via scripts or via an admin UI.
- **Huey** chatbot (eventually)

Note all requests require credentials, with the exceptions of getting the application
version and security policy.

## üîê Authentication

The good news is that as an API user should just need to send an access token
in the `Authorization` header and all endpoints should *just work*. The
notable exception being the `/auth/firebase` endpoint which exchanges a firebase
SSO token for a Wriveted API Access Token.

As a developer your access token will be provided to you by the Wriveted team.

You can check it by calling the `GET /auth/me` endpoint.

## üö® Authorization

The API implements role based access control, only particular roles are allowed
to add new schools or edit collections.
