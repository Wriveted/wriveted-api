"""
Integration tests for CMS content visibility enforcement.

Tests the visibility access control system:
- WRIVETED: System content, visible to all authenticated users
- PUBLIC: Visible to all authenticated users
- SCHOOL: Visible only to users in the same school
- PRIVATE: Visible only to creator and school admins

Security requirements:
- User from School A cannot see School B's private content
- User from School A sees their school's SCHOOL-visibility content
- All users see PUBLIC and WRIVETED content

Note: The CMS management API (/v1/cms/content/{id}) requires superuser/service account access.
Visibility filtering is enforced via the /v1/cms/content/random endpoint which allows user-based access.
