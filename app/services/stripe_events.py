def process_stripe_event(event_type: str, event_data):
    """
    Processes an event sent by Stripe webhook.

    These webhook events are sent asynchronously, and order is not guaranteed -
    i.e. when a new customer subscribes, a `customer.subscription.created` event
    may be sent before a `customer.created` event.
    See https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks/best-practices#event-ordering

    Because of this, it may be wise to consider overarching transactions and use-cases,
    fetching data from Stripe as needed, rather than blindly processing each event separately.
    For example, when a new customer subscribes, we may want to establish a
    user/subscription/product relationship in a single transaction, rather than piecemeal.

    The main use-cases we want to handle at this stage are:
    - A brand new customer subscribes, without an existing account
    - An existing Free tier customer subscribes
    - An existing customer modifies their subscription (e.g. upgrades, downgrades, or cancels)

    We can still capture other events for logging purposes,
    but we need not apply any business logic in them.

    It's worth noting that it's only the events we receive that are asynchronous,
    not the underlying processes and database transactions at Stripe's end.
    So, for example, when a new customer successfully subscribes, and the following events are received
    in the order listed (with the actual chronological order of the underlying process in parentheses):

    (2) - `customer.subscription.created`
            (contains the `customer` id, information about the subscription)
    (3) - `checkout.session.completed`
            (contains the `customer` id, the `subscription` id, and any included
            `client_reference_id` sent by our frontend to identify the user)
    (1) - `customer.created`
            (contains the `customer` information, but no `subscription` information)

    We -could- handle each of these events separately (with the incomplete pictures they each provide),
    but will be able to handle them more efficiently if we target the event with the most significance and pointers/id's.

    For this example, it's most convenient to do this by only heavily processing the `checkout.session.completed`
    event, which includes id's for relevant instances of `customer` and `subscription` (and by extension `price`/`product`) in its payload.
    As this is the chronologically final event in this use-case, we can then simply query the Stripe API for the
    relevant instances of `customer` and `subscription`, knowing that Stripe has already processed these.
    This effectively gives us the full picture in a single event, instead of waiting for and blindly processing the
    `customer.created` and `customer.subscription.created` events.
