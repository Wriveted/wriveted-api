## Engineering Principles

- **Test-Design-Code Alignment**: When tests fail, analyze the **design intent** (documentation, API contracts), **current implementation**, and **test expectations** to determine the correct path forward. Don't take the easy path of changing tests to match broken implementations. Instead, compare all three sources to determine what the correct behavior should be and fix accordingly.
- **REST API Consistency**: DELETE operations should return appropriate HTTP status codes per REST conventions (typically 204 No Content for successful deletions with no response body, or 200 OK if returning meaningful response data).
- **Declarative Database Infrastructure**: Use `alembic_utils` with Python-defined functions and triggers in `app/db/functions.py` and `app/db/triggers.py` for version-controlled, type-safe database logic.

## Code Style

Only professional comments should be used:
- Remove task-focused comments like "OLD import removed"
- Remove "NEW:" markers etc.
- Focus on why not what
- Remove comments that just restate the code

Ruff for linting (configured in `pyproject.toml`).

## Development Commands

See [README.md](README.md) for full setup, testing, migration, and deployment instructions.

Quick reference:

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Install dependencies | `poetry install` |
| Start stack | `docker compose up -d --build` |
| Apply migrations | `docker compose run --rm migration` |
| Seed data | `docker compose run --rm --entrypoint python -v "$PWD/scripts:/app/scripts" api /app/scripts/seed_admin_ui_data.py --emit-tokens --tokens-format json` |
| Unit tests | `poetry run pytest app/tests/unit/ -v` |
| Integration tests | `bash scripts/integration-tests.sh` |
| Single test | `poetry run pytest -v app/tests/integration/test_specific.py::test_function` |
| Lint | `poetry run ruff check` |
| Lint fix | `poetry run ruff check --fix` |
| Run API directly | `uvicorn app.main:app --reload` |
| Run internal API | `gunicorn --workers=1 --worker-class=uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker app.internal_api:internal_app` |

**Important**: Integration tests should be run using `bash scripts/integration-tests.sh` which provides the proper Docker environment. Running integration tests directly with pytest may encounter async fixture issues. Ensure no conflicting postgres containers are running on port 5432.

### Configuring Local User Permissions

To grant admin access for testing the CMS/chatflow builder in the admin UI:

```sql
UPDATE users SET type = 'WRIVETED' WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';

INSERT INTO wriveted_admins (id)
SELECT id FROM users WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
```

After updating, log out and back in to get a new JWT with updated permissions.

## Architecture Overview

### Dual API Structure
- **Public API** (`app.main:app`): External-facing REST API with authentication/authorization
- **Internal API** (`app.internal_api:internal_app`): Background task processing, webhook handling

### Database
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy 2.0 with async support (asyncpg driver)
- **Migrations**: Alembic for schema management
- **Base Class**: Custom `Base` class with auto-generated table names
- **User Model**: Uses joined-table inheritance for different user types (Student, Educator, Parent, etc.)
- **Connection**: Always use `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI` environment variable

### Code Organization
- **Routes**: `app/api/` with dependencies in `app/api/dependencies/`
- **Schemas**: Pydantic request/response models in `app/schemas/`
- **Repositories**: Domain-focused data access in `app/repositories/` (modern pattern)
- **CRUD**: Legacy data access in `app/crud/` (being phased out)
- **Services**: Business logic in `app/services/`
- **Configuration**: Pydantic-based settings in `app/config.py`

See [docs/architecture-service-layer.md](docs/architecture-service-layer.md) for the full service layer architecture.

### Migration Workflow
1. Modify SQLAlchemy models in `app/models/`
2. Add imports to `app/models/__init__.py`
3. Generate migration: `poetry run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Description"`
4. Review generated migration file manually. Models are source of truth.
5. Apply: `poetry run alembic upgrade head`

## Common Patterns and Pitfalls

### Data Access
- **Repository pattern** is the modern approach; `app/crud/` is legacy (being phased out)
- All new services should use proper async/await patterns
- Pydantic schemas use consistent field names between database and API

### API Endpoints
- Many endpoints require service account or admin authentication
- Custom validation endpoints like `/flows/{id}/validate` for business logic
- List endpoints support filtering, searching, and pagination consistently

### Testing
- Always use `bash scripts/integration-tests.sh` for integration tests (proper Docker environment)
- Clean up test data in fixtures to prevent test interference
- Be careful with SQLAlchemy async session management in tests
- Test configuration lives in `conftest.py` files

### Performance
- Bulk operations: use batch create/update for efficiency
- Full-text search uses PostgreSQL tsvector and GIN indexes

### REST Conventions
- Verify actual API behavior vs REST conventions for status codes
- Ensure async/await consistency across all database operations
