This repository implements a REST API to add, edit, and remove information about 
Users, Books, Schools and Library Collections for Wriveted.

The API is designed for use by multiple users:
* Library Management Systems. In particular see the section on updating and setting Schools collections.
* Wriveted Staff either directly via scripts or via an admin UI.
* End users via Huey chatbot or other Wriveted applications.


## Poetry

Install poetry, then install dependencies with:

```shell
poetry install
```

Add a new dependency e.g. `pydantic` with:

```shell
poetry add pydantic
```


## Database Migrations

Login to GCP:

```shell
gcloud auth application-default login
```

Start the [Cloud SQL proxy](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/quickstart-proxy-test?authuser=1).

```shell
cloud_sql_proxy -instances=hardbyte-wriveted-development:australia-southeast1:wriveted=tcp:5432
```

Set the environment variable `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI` with the proxied database path (otherwise it will create a local sqlite database):

```
export SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI=postgresql://postgres:gJduFxMylJN1v44B@localhost/postgres
```

Then create a new migration:

```shell
poetry run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Create first tables"
```

Apply all migrations:

```shell
poetry run alembic upgrade head
```


# Deployment

## Google Cloud Platform

Cloud Build + Cloud SQL + Cloud Run

Build the Docker image using Cloud Build:

`gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/hardbyte-wriveted-development/wriveted-api`

Then deploy it (or use the Google Console):

```shell
gcloud run deploy wriveted-api \
  --image gcr.io/hardbyte-wriveted-development/wriveted-api \
  --add-cloudsql-instances=wriveted \
  --platform managed \
  --set-env-vars="POSTGRESQL_DATABASE_SOCKET_PATH=/cloudsql" \
  --set-secrets=POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD=wriveted-api-cloud-sql-password:latest,SECRET_KEY=wriveted-api-secret-key:latest
  
```

This will probably fail the first few times for a new GCP project - you'll have
to follow the clues to add appropriate permissions.
At a minimum you'll have to add the secrets to Secret Manager, then attach
the `roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor` role to the service account used by 
Cloud Run for those secrets.

You will be prompted to allow unauthenticated invocations: respond `y`. We 
implement our own authentication in the FastAPI app.

Note you will have to configure the Cloud SQL database manually 
(orchestrating with Terraform is left as an exercise for the reader ðŸ‘‹).

Use a public IP address for the Cloud SQL instance (don't worry about the
private VPC method it is way more expensive).
Smallest instance with shared CPU is fine 



## ðŸš¨ Authorization

The API implements RBAC + row level access control on resources. Each user or service account
is linked to roles (e.g. `"admin"`, `"lms"`, or `"student"`) and principals (e.g. `user-xyz`,
`school-1`). Endpoints have access control lists that specify what permissions are required for
different principals to access the resource at that endpoint. For example to access a school
the access control list could look like this:

```python
access_control_list = [
    (Allow, "role:admin", "create"),
    (Allow, "role:admin", "read"),
    (Allow, "role:admin", "update"),
    (Allow, "role:admin", "delete"),
    (Allow, "role:admin", "batch"),

    (Allow, "role:lms", "batch"),
    (Allow, "role:lms", "update"),

    (Deny, "role:student", "update"),
    (Deny, "role:student", "delete"),

    (Allow, f"school:{self.id}", "read"),
    (Allow, f"school:{self.id}", "update"),
]
```
