Example short summaries:
- “Harry and his dog Hopper have done everything together, ever since Hopper was a jumpy little puppy. But one day the unthinkable happens. Harry comes home from school... and Hopper isn't there to greet him.”
- “Something strange is happening in Alfie's town. Instead of shiny coins from the Tooth Fairy, kids are waking up to dead slugs, live spiders, and other dreadfully icky things under their pillows. Who would do something so horrific?”

Example long summaries:
- “An affectionate, sometimes bashful pig named Wilbur befriends a spider named Charlotte, who lives in the rafters above his pen. A prancing, playful bloke, Wilbur is devastated when he learns of the destiny that befalls all those of porcine persuasion. Determined to save her friend, Charlotte spins a web that reads Some Pig, convincing the farmer and surrounding community that Wilbur is no ordinary animal and should be saved. In this story of friendship, hardship and the passing on into time, E.B. White reminds us to open our eyes to the wonder and miracle often found in the simplest of things.”
- “Andy and Terry's have the most amazing treehouse in the world! It's got a bowling alley, a see-through swimming pool, a tank full of man-eating sharks, a giant catapult, a secret underground laboratory and a marshmallow machine that follows you around and shoots marshmallows into your mouth whenever you're hungry.

CAT_HAT: Simple books, more complex than a picture book for early child readers who have basic reading skills. These books often have an illustration on every page. (e.g. Cat in the Hat by Dr. Seuss)

TREEHOUSE: Early chapter books for developing child readers who can handle longer and slightly more complex sentences and can read independently  (e.g. the 13-Storey Treehouse, the Captain Underpants series, National Geographic Kids Readers: Rocks and Minerals)

CHARLIE_CHOCOLATE:
Chapter books for proficient child readers who can independently read more challenging books with complex plots and themes. (e.g. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory by Roald Dahl)

Each hue should be independently given a score between 0.0 and 1.0 to two decimal places measuring how strongly the hue applies to the book.

Below is a list of Hues, you must map these Hues and only these Hues depending on how strongly the book fits the tones expressed by the Hue:
